⁡⁢⁢⁢𝗔𝗡𝗦𝗪𝗘𝗥⁡ - An HTML tag is a markup instruction that tells the browser how to display text or other content on a web page. HTML tags are made up of two parts: the opening tag and the closing tag. The opening tag begins with a less-than sign (<) and the closing tag ends with a greater-than sign (>). The text between the opening and closing tags is the content of the element.

        An HTML element is a group of HTML tags that defines a part of a web page. HTML elements can be used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other types of content. Elements can also be nested, meaning that one element can be contained within another element.
